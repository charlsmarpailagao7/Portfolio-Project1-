At first I was taught <strong>C++</strong> by our Senior Highschool Teacher we were learning about the basics at first but gradually came to making our own calculator and<br> even something like
 a temperature converter.
I dont remember much but it was fun making those codes and learning C++ was quite confusing but I managed<br> even though I made alot of mistakes,
 some were missing <strong>semicolons(;)</strong>. I couldn't find them neither recognise which was missing a semicolon, but a single mistake<br> can stop the entire program from running.
 Through practice, I learned that every detail in coding matters. these early experiences shaped how I approach<br> programming today.</p>
